When you click the "+" button a right panel will appear for you to input the desired dates of the reservation, this component
is already programmed to only allow reservations that start 1 day plus the current date, and when you select a date, it automatically closes the range to maximum of 3 days. In addition to that, the component only allows reservations with max 30 days in the future.
